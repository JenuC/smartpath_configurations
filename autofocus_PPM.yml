# ========== AUTOFOCUS CONFIGURATION FOR PPM MICROSCOPE ==========
# Autofocus parameters per objective
# These settings control the autofocus behavior during image acquisition
#
# Parameters:
#   n_steps: Number of Z positions to sample during autofocus (higher = more accurate but slower)
#   search_range_um: Total Z range to search in micrometers (centered on current position)
#   n_tiles: Spatial frequency - autofocus runs every N tiles during large acquisitions (lower = more frequent but slower)
